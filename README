This is an Android Tamil Application.

This is using the CSS technology and WebView to render Tamil fonts as it has no default support for Tamil till Android 4.0 (ICS).

Hope others can use this same technology to build application using WebView (Mostly the devs who have web development experience over Java development).

Note: There is a known bug with Android Browser 2.1, so this technology won't be effective for Android 2.1 mobiles.

I do not own the copyright of the images and the Bamini font. You can use rest of the cde as per the following license.
