This is a Android Tamil Application.

This is using the CSS technology and WebView to show Tamil fonts as there are not default support for Tamil in Android mobiles yet.

Hope others can use this same technology to build application using WebView.

Note: There is a bug with Android Browser 2.1, so this technology won't be effective for Android 2.1 mobiles.
